## Technical Patterns and Architecture

### Role-Based Design

- Permission-based controller logic
- Role-differentiated data responses
- Modular and secure access handling

### Aggregation Pipelines

- MongoDB aggregations for reporting and statistics
- Optimized queries with custom pipeline stages

### Transaction Management

- Multi-document MongoDB transactions
- Robust rollback support with sessions

### Security Practices

- Input validation and data sanitization
- Password confirmation for sensitive actions
- Centralized and consistent error handling

### File Handling

- PDF generation via Puppeteer for certificates
- Streamed file response with temporary cleanup

---

## Error Handling

- Custom `AppError` class for consistency
- Centralized Express middleware
- Clean, descriptive error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes

---

## Scalability and Maintainability

### Database Optimization

- Indexing on frequent queries
- Lean queries and selective population

### Performance

- Use of `Promise.all` for parallel execution
- Cached data for high-frequency endpoints
- Optimized aggregation pipelines

### Maintainable Design

- Modularized controllers and logic layers
- Unified response structures across endpoints
- Graceful error propagation and logging
